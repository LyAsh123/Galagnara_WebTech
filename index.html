	You may think that I'm talkin' foolish
You've heard that I'm wild and I'm free
You may wonder how I can promise you now
This love that I feel for you always will be
But you're not just time that I'm killin'
I'm no longer one of those guys
As sure as I live, this love that I give
Is gonna be yours until the day that I die
Oh, baby, I'm gonna love you forever
Forever and ever amen
As long as old men sit and talk about the weather
As long as old women sit and talk about old men
If you wonder how long I'll be faithful
I'll be happy to tell you again
I'm gonna love you forever and ever
Forever and ever, amen
They say time takes its toll on a body
Makes the young girls brown hair turn gray
But honey, I don't care, I ain't in love with your hair
And if it all fell out, well, I'd love you anyway
They say time can play tricks on a memory
Make people forget things they knew
Well, it's easy to see, it's happenin' to me
I've already forgotten every woman but you
Oh, darlin', I'm gonna love you forever
Forever and ever amen
As long as old men sit and talk about the weather
As long as old women sit and talk about old men

		Hello mahal! This may seem so cringey to you but... 
		Just want to say na despite all the circumstances in life,
		I am certain that you'd be able to get through all the problems you're in right now.
		I am aware of how fed up you are of the people surrounding you, including me.
		Just want to let you know that I will always be supporting you.
		It's okay to take a rest, give yourself some space.
		I'll be waiting for you 'til the wounds in your heart are healed.
		I am willing to wait. For now, let me be the friend you'd always ask to play with.
		My love for you is pure despite our gender similarities. I fully accept who you are just like how you are to me.
		I am hoping that this isn't the end. Tomorrow's the start of another year. 
		To be honest, I wanted you to be part of my 2023 regardless of our relationship status. You might not know this but
		you're in my favorite list on facebook and the only person there HAHAHAHA! You've been my favorite person this year
		and will always be. I promise not to get fed up hearing all your rants in life. 
		Please let me bear half of you problems. It would make me much happier and easier for you to bear.
		Take a distance from what's weighing you down. There nothing that hinders you from showing off your weaknesses.
		I know how volatile you are, your mood swings in a blink. You are fragile but strong.
		I'm sure you'd be able to get throught it. After all, life is full of uncertainty, you just got to learn to live with it.
		I love you so much! And always will.

If you wonder how long I'll be faithful

Forever and ever, amen
They say time takes its toll on a body
Makes the young girls brown hair turn gray
But honey, I don't care, I ain't in love with your hair
And if it all fell out, well, I'd love you anyway
They say time can play tricks on a memory
Make people forget things they knew
Well, it's easy to see, it's happenin' to me
I've already forgotten every woman but you
Oh, darlin', I'm gonna love you forever

You may wonder how I can promise you now
This love that I feel for you always will be
But you're not just time that I'm killin'

Well, it's easy to see, it's happenin' to me
I've already forgotten every woman but you
Oh, darlin', I'm gonna love you forever
Forever and ever amen
As long as old men sit and talk about the weather
As long as old women sit and talk about old men
If you wonder how long I'll be faithful
Well, just listen to how this song ends
I'm gonna love you forever and ever
Forever and ever, amen
I'm gonna love you forever and ever
Forever and ever, forever and ever
Forever and ever, amen
You may think that I'm talkin' foolish
You've heard that I'm wild and I'm free
You may wonder how I can promise you now
This love that I feel for you always will be
But you're not just time that I'm killin'
I'm no longer one of those guys
As sure as I live, this love that I give
Is gonna be yours until the day that I die
Oh, baby, I'm gonna love you forever
Forever and ever amen
As long as old men sit and talk about the weather
As long as old women sit and talk about old men
If you wonder how long I'll be faithful
I'll be happy to tell you again
I'm gonna love you forever and ever
Forever and ever, amen
They say time takes its toll on a body
Makes the young girls brown hair turn gray
But honey, I don't care, I ain't in love with your hair
And if it all fell out, well, I'd love you anyway
They say time can play tricks on a memory
Make people forget things they knew
Well, it's easy to see, it's happenin' to me
I've already forgotten every woman but you
Oh, darlin', I'm gonna love you forever
Forever and ever amen
